The Branch-and-cut algorithm to compute lower bounds on Ramsey Numbers (described in the publication mentioned above) can be downloaded by clicking here (see the files above). To use the solver, a license file is provided. To compile and run the code  CPLEX libraries are required.

The software is for academic purposes only, see also the file license.md  provided.
